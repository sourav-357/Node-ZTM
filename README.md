# Node.js & Express – ZTM Course Repository

Welcome to my **Node.js & Express learning repository** 📚.  
This repo contains all the **code, notes, and mini-projects** I create while completing the  
**[Zero to Mastery: Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-nodejs-developer-zero-to-mastery/)**.  

It serves as a **personal learning journal** as well as a **showcase of backend development skills** that I’m building step by step.

## 📌 About the Course
The **ZTM Node.js Developer Course** is a complete journey from beginner to advanced backend development.  
It covers everything from **Node.js fundamentals** to **real-world production applications**.  

### 🧑‍💻 Topics I will be covering:
-  Node.js Fundamentals (Modules, File System, Events, Streams)
-  Working with **NPM** and dependencies
-  Building servers with **HTTP** and **Express.js**
-  REST API Development (CRUD operations, RESTful design)
-  Middleware, Error Handling, Logging
-  Authentication (JWT, Sessions, Cookies)
-  Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
-  Deployment, Security, and Production Best Practices
-  Real-World Projects (full-stack integration later)

This repo grows as I progress, so check commits for step-by-step learning milestones.
